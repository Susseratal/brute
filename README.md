# What?
This is a silly bit of fun to practice programming in different languages, and it's more interesting than writing normal hello world programs  
Usage:  

        ./brute.? -m message 
        ./brute.? -f file.txt

Either of these should work

This was inspired by [someone who wrote this in ruby](https://github.com/kickinespresso/brute_hello)

WARNING: The c++ version compiles to brute.exe - this does not necessarily mean it's a windows compatible exe. I wrote that bit on linux, and just needed something quick to stick on the end of the file for gitignore. It should still work, but I haven't tested it on windows
