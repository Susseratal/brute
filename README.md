# What?
This is a silly bit of fun to practice programming in different languages, and it's more interesting than writing normal hello world programs  
Usage:  

        python brute.py/.cs -m message 
        python brute.py/.cs -f file.txt

Either of these should work

This was inspired by [someone who wrote this in ruby](https://github.com/kickinespresso/brute_hello)
