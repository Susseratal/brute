# What?
This is a silly bit of fun to practice programming in different languages, and it's more interesting than writing normal hello world programs  
All compiled languages are decompiled and should be built using the necessary tool i.e. dotnet build, make, java/javac etc...

Usage on compiled binaries:  

        ./brute <-m/-f> <"message"/file.txt>

or
        
        python brute.py <-m/-f> <"message"/file.txt>

This was inspired by [someone who wrote this in ruby](https://github.com/kickinespresso/brute_hello)  
Languages I have done myself:  

        - [x] Python
        - [x] C#
        - [x] C++
        - [ ] Java - what a dumb language
