# What?
This is a silly bit of fun to practice programming in different languages, and it's more interesting than writing normal hello world programs  
Usage:  

        ./brute.? -m message 
        ./brute.? -f file.txt

Either of these should work

This was inspired by [someone who wrote this in ruby](https://github.com/kickinespresso/brute_hello)  
Languages I have done:  

        - [x] Python
        - [x] C#
        - [x] C++
        - [ ] Java - what a dumb language
